trying to make a better connected place


The simplest possible streamlined integration between the Domain Name System and peer-to-peer overlay networks, enabling self-issued public keys to function as sovereign, publicly addressable, censorship-resistant top-level domains. This system is accessible to anyone capable of maintaining a private key



# TLDR 

- To publish resource records for your key, sign a small encoded DNS packet (<= 1000 bytes) and publish it on the DHT (through a relay if necessary).
- 
- To resolve some key's resources, applications query the DHT directly, or through a relay, and verify the signature themselves.

- Clients and Relays cache records extensively and minimize DHT traffic as much as possible for improved scalability.
- 
- The DHT drops records after a few hours, so users, their friends, or service providers should periodically republish their records to the DHT. Also Pkarr relays could republish records recently requested, to keep popular records alive too.
- 
- Optional: Existing applications unaware of Pkarr can still function if the user added a Pkarr-aware DNS servers to their operating system DNS servers.

# Clients
Pkarr-enabled Applications
Native applications can directly query and verify signed records from the DHT if they are not behind NAT. Otherwise, they will need to use a Pkarr Relay.

Browser web apps should try calling the local Pkarr relay at the default port 6881. If not accessible, they must query a remote relay as a fallback. In either case, these apps should allow users to configure relays of their choice.

Clients with private keys can also submit signed records either directly to the DHT or through a Pkarr relay to update their records when needed

# Relays
Pkarr relays are optional but they:

Enable web applications to query the DHT through relays
Act as a large caching layer for many users to provide lower latency, better reliability, and improved scalability
Relays are very light and cheap to operate, making them easy to run altruistically. Private and paid relays are also possible


# Republishers
Services and hosting providers mentioned in a user's Resource Records are incentivized to republish these records and keep them alive on the DHT, for the same reasons they are incentivized to gain that user in the first place


# Expectations
To ensure good scalability and resilience, a few expectations need to be set:

This is not a storage platform
Records are ephemeral and will be dropped by the DHT without regular refreshing
Popular records may be refreshed by DNS servers as they receive queries
This is not a realtime communication medium
Records are heavily cached like in any DNS system
Record updates should be infrequent, and relays enforce strict rate-limiting
Record updates may take time to propagate due to extensive caching, even with a 1-second TTL
In case of a cache miss, traversing the DHT might take few seconds
